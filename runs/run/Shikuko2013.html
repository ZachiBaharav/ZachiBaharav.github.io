"The walking course is approximately 1,200 km long and can take anywhere from 30 to 60 days to complete.". 
30Miles/day = 48km==> approx. 1,200/50 = 24days. 20Miles/day==>36days.

<li> When to go:: Summer - it's a hot time to go. It will be imperative that you carry a light pack and only a few clothes. 
March? This is the classic pilgrimage season. Walking in April is good, a bit rainier yet - this is a cooler month than July, August. September and October - the temperatures will be cooler and perhaps not as rainy. 
It's a more pleasant walk when you are not sweating all the time.
<li> Walking in parts :: Walking in parts is a certain an acceptable idea. 
I met many Japanese pilgrims who walked only during long holiday weekends. 
In fact, I met one Japanese couple who was finishing the pilgrimage after four years of effort. That's dedication.
<li> I recommend that you buy the English version of the walking map. 
<li> I also think you should look for David Turkington's webpage - that might be helpful as well.
<li> The first 23 temples will take about a week. It is perhaps the best part of the pilgrimage in terms of variety of terrain. 
The next two prefectures include long, long walks which 1) will take a lot of time or 2) can be covered by a bus. 
We can discuss this later.
