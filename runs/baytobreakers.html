Subject: Bay lands to Breakers (Palo-Alto to Half-Moon bay)
<br>

Hi all, <br>
.. zipped specific year/time details.

 We will start at 6:00 AM from the Baylands ; <br>
 The second leg, starting from Woodside, will leave at 8:30 AM from Woodside elementary. <br>
 We expect to be at Half-Moon bay around 11:30->12:00, where we will dip in the water (optional), change (mandatory), and go to the Three Amigos (or something else near by).
 I will send an email later on, as we finalize things, but this is just to start things. <br>

Some technical details:
<ul>
<li> Meeting points:
<br>Baylands: right by the Palo Alto airport parking.
 <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=295752" target="blank"> http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=295752</a> . There's a lone-tree right there.
<br> Woodside elementary school:
<a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=295750" target="blank">http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=295750 </a>    I always find people missing it: when you go off from 280 at 84, you head WEST. After crossing Canada road, you have the fires-tation on your left, and then the school.
<li> Drop bags : if you want to see a bag of changing cloth at the end, you better bring it to me (or Joe) before. More details later.
<li> Transportation back: Zachi Baharav : Zachi + 5; Joe Murphy : Joe + 2. BTW, I plan on going there Friday with the car to half moon bay, leave the car, and come back to PA on bikes (Tunitas creek). If anyone want to join, let me know..
<li>
Okay; The route:
<ol>
<li>Bay-lands to Woodside: 12M.  6AM to 8:30.
<a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=289094" target="blank">http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=289094 </a>
<li>Woodside to Beach: 18M , 8:30 to 12:00
<a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=289900" target="blank">http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=289900 </a>  (it shows shorter here, because the travel through Huddart park and Purisima are longer than the straight lines I drew.)
<li>For details on those sections:
Huddart:
<a href="http://www.co.sanmateo.ca.us/vgn/images/portal/cit_609/14772367huddartparkmap.pdf" target="blank">http://www.co.sanmateo.ca.us/vgn/images/portal/cit_609/14772367huddartparkmap.pdf </a>
we are getting in through the Green-road entrance. There are bathrooms + water near the meadows.
Then we take Big Tree trail to Zwierlin (again, water+). Then we follow Dean Trail to Chinquapin (this is the only tricky turn there: Calls for a short left and then right)., and then all the way to the top.
<li>On Purisima side, we just take Purisima Creek trail all the way down.

</ol>
</ul>

We may have min-aid station at the end of Purisima: this is real important, as it can get hot and exposed on Higgins canyonâ€¦ (Thanks George!)
Happy trails, (and I will email more later, as the list firms up, and we get closer)
